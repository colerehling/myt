                    <p><b>What is Mark Your Territory?</b></p>
                    <p>Mark Your Territory is game where you can log entries where you have peed as <b>marks</b>. The world is divided up into grids so when you mark a spot you now own that <b>territory</b>. Compete with your friends to gain the most territory and conquer the world!</p>
                    <p><b>Home Page:</b></p>
                    <p>The home page shows a map with all of your personal marks. Beneath the map is a box where you can add a new entry. To log your entry, hit “Create New Mark”. A box will appear where you can add a comment. Once you hit “Log Mark”, your entry will be uploaded. Your location will automatically be gathered and your pin will be uploaded to the map. </p>
                    <p><b>Global Page:</b></p>
                    <p>The global page shows a map with marks from all users throughout the world. Here you can see what territories you currently own and all the territories you’ve conquered. Owning a territory means that you are the last person to have peed in that territory. Conquering territory comes from owning the closest territory to unowned territory. All of the territory that is yours will be filled with the same color so you can see the part of the world that is yours. </p>
                    <p><b>Terminology:</b></p>
                    <p><b>Mark: </b>any individual entry you have logged</p>
                    <p><b>Territory:</b> the location of where you have marked</p>
                    <p><b>Owning Territory:</b> when you are the last person to mark a territory, you own it. When someone else marks that territory, you do not own it anymore</p>
                    <p><b>Conquering Territory:</b> all unowned territory is conquered by the nearest owned territory and will appear as that color on the map</p>
                    <p><b>Unique Territories Marked:</b> shows the number of different territories you have peed at</p>
